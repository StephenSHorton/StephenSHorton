My name is Stephen Horton. I'm a software engineer with [Agility Digital](https://www.linkedin.com/company/agility-digital/).

I came from coding video games to building web applications and on to building back-end server code. I've used several technologies throughout my career. I enjoy my profession and I want to be a true App Developer one day, whether it be solo freelancing or leading a team of people. I love coding.
